📊 AI for Predictive Modeling (Regression & Classification)
🔍 PredictiveModelingAI is a Machine Learning project that builds and evaluates predictive models for regression and classification tasks. The project applies multiple algorithms, compares their performance, and optimizes them using feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

📌 Features
✅ Regression Models – Implements Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
✅ Classification Models – Includes Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and SVM.
✅ Data Preprocessing – Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data.
✅ Model Evaluation – Uses MSE, R² Score, Accuracy, and Confusion Matrix.
✅ Hyperparameter Optimization – Applies Grid Search & Randomized Search for tuning models.

🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Python – Core programming language
2. Scikit-Learn – Machine Learning library
3. NumPy & Pandas – Data handling and preprocessing
4. Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
5. Jupyter Notebook – Interactive coding environment
